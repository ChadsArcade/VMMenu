# VMMenu
Vector Mame Menu for ZVG

Requires iniparser from Nicolas Devillard, at https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser

Requires ZVG Dos dev kit
Requires a DJGPP compile environment under DOS, I used the same version as used for DOS MAME circa .104

I'm no C coder, please be gentle. This was my first attempt at C.

I'v included a make file and sample compile batch file, but you may need to edit the paths in these to reflect your own environment.
